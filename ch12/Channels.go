/*
The worker goroutine blocks at ch <- "Hello from worker!" until the main function reads from ch.
The program synchronizes both goroutines implicitly.
Unbuffered channels are best for strict synchronization between goroutines.
*/

/*
buffered channels:
ch:=make(chan string,3)
The worker does not block when sending 3 messages because the buffer has enough space (cap = 3).
The main function can read the messages later, avoiding immediate synchronization.
ðŸš€ Buffered channels are useful when:

You need asynchronous communication between goroutines.
You want to avoid blocking the sender while waiting for a receiver
